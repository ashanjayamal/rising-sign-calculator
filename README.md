# Rising Sign Calculator

A web-based astrological tool that calculates your Rising Sign (Ascendant) based on your birth details.



## 🌟 About

The Rising Sign Calculator determines the zodiac sign that was rising on the eastern horizon at the time of your birth. In astrology, the Rising Sign (or Ascendant) influences your outward style, appearance, and how others perceive you upon first meeting.

## ✨ Features

- Calculate your Rising Sign based on:
  - Birth date
  - Birth time
  - Latitude and longitude of birth location
  - Timezone
- Display zodiac sign images
- User-friendly interface with responsive design
- Works entirely in the browser (no server-side calculations)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

This calculator uses astronomical principles to determine the Rising Sign:

1. Calculates Local Sidereal Time (LST) at birth
2. Determines the ascendant degree based on LST and birth location
3. Maps the ascendant degree to the corresponding zodiac sign

The calculation is based on astronomical formulas implemented in JavaScript, including:
- Julian date conversion
- Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time calculation
- Local Sidereal Time calculation
- Ascendant degree calculation

The Rising Sign Calculator works on:
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile devices
- Tablets

## 📸 Image Credits

The zodiac sign images used in this project are stored in the `images` directory.
